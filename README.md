# 📱 Product Price Prediction 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the **price range of mobile phones** based on their hardware features and specifications.  
Using **Python** and **Machine Learning algorithms**, models are trained to classify mobile phones into four price categories — from low to very high — based on attributes such as RAM, battery power, and display resolution.  

The project demonstrates **data analysis**, **model building**, and **performance comparison** using various supervised learning algorithms.

Project Workflow

Data Loading – Load Final_price_Bob.csv using pandas.

Data Exploration – Understand dataset structure and relationships.

Train-Test Split – Divide data into training and testing sets.

Model Training – Build and train multiple ML models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model Evaluation – Compare model performance using accuracy and classification_report.



📈 Results & Insights

Among all models, SVM and KNN provided the highest accuracy for predicting price ranges.

RAM, battery power, and pixel resolution are the top influencing features.

The model successfully classifies mobiles into one of four price range categories.
